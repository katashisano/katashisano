Hey there! If you're reading this, you probably found my github profile by luck, or if I have done anything cool on github by now, I probably forgot to change this.

</br>

### What I do

I don't really code that much, I just code when I really need it or when I need a solution to a problem or want to "improve" some open source project to fit my needs. 
Although, when I code, I usually don't upload the code to github unless it was planned to be like that from the beggining of the project, since most of the code I write is unreadable.

I have a few cool/useful projects, like a Minecraft modpack mod downloader for linux as there is no Curseforge launcher on linux, and I wouldn't like to install it either to be honest. I would upload it to github, but the code is a mess.

(Stuff I said earlier I didn't actually do)

Other than that, I mostly play games and like emulation a lot.
 I  like Apple products a lot, and by "Apple products" I mean specifically iPhones/iOS and Apple Music. They have pretty good looking UI, so, you might see me replicating that in my projects if I am ever able to and if it's worth it.

</br>

### Plans for the future

Since I not much long ago became a linux user, that being about 10 months(started with popos!, currently on arch), I will very likely develop qol utilities. Not much more, also, exclusively for linux, unless I decide to make a game someday ofcourse.
